A sandbox game made in Unity5



#CubeWorldUnity
A unity5 project folder, could be directly imported
into Unity5.

Originally Forked from:

#CubeWorld(@Deprecated)

This folder is the base C++ library for the game
Not in use currently, will be used when UE4 added
But currently, I will only develop in Unity.

Thanks @federicodangelo for your wonderful work!
